===============================

This is a reimagination of the classic arcade game *Frogger* in which you (who
are not a frog) cross a busy street to reach the water.  Your obstacles are not
cars and trucks; instead, they are beetles.

**How to Play**

Start the game in your browser by opening the file index.html.

Use the arrow keys to move your player left, right, up, and down.  To win points,
cross the street without colliding with any of the speeding beetles.  Once you
reach the water or hit/get hit by a beetle, you are returned to the starting
point for another round.  Each collision with a beetle results in a lost life.
Lives remaining are displayed on the lower left of the game board.  Once you
lose all your turns, the game ends.  You can hit the refresh button in your
browser to restart.

The beetles move at random rates.  Because their speeds are variable, they
will occasionally change lanes to avoid beetles in their way&mdash;not you, of
course! As you make more successful crossings, the average beetle speed will
increase.  The number of beetles will also increase from three at the beginning
to five (though speed will mercifully drop when a beetle is added&mdash;only
to rise again).

Enjoy!
